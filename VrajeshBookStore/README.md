This application name VrajeshBookStore is for Book where you can find Books. I created a dynamic web application by using the NET Core 5 framework's 
advanced features. The project made use of the ASP.NET Core Web App model, which simplified the process of establishing secure "data" 
folders for private data and individual user account authentication. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture used in the application
ensures a structured design. The information loads more smoothly and is simpler for customers to get around when the Razor Runtime Compiler 
is used. I added a Bootswatch theme to improve the visual appeal and give the user interface an elegant appearance. In order to enhance user 
interaction with the website, I also included a selection box for content administration.
